        <p className='mb-4'>
          Inter Miami extended their unbeaten streak in the 2025 MLS season with a 1â€“0 win over Columbus Crew, in a unique fixture hosted at Cleveland Browns Stadium. The match was decided by a first-half goal from Benjamin Cremaschi, who found the net with a diving header following a fast-paced counter-attack.

        <p className='mb-4'>
          The buildup to Cremaschiâ€™s goal began with Luis SuÃ¡rez sparking the break and Marcelo Weigandt delivering a perfect cross into the box. Cremaschiâ€™s finish came in the 30th minute and stood as the game-winner.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>
          Columbus Crew, who entered the match unbeaten, were aiming to set a new franchise record for the best start to an MLS season. Instead, they equaled their 2010 run with a 5â€“1â€“3 record after the loss.

          Strategic Venue Change and Strong Attendance
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Although the match was technically a home game for the Crew, it was played 145 miles north in Cleveland, at the NFLâ€™s Browns Stadium. This strategic venue switch, orchestrated by team owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam, was designed to boost visibility and capitalize on Lionel Messiâ€™s presence.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>
          The move paid off, drawing an impressive crowd of 60,614, just shy of the stadiumâ€™s capacity. Fans from both Columbus and Miami made the trip, and the energy in the stands reflected the hype surrounding Messiâ€™s first appearance in Cleveland.

          Oscar Ustari Shines, Messi Nearly Scores
        </h2>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Goalkeeper Oscar Ustari played a crucial role in securing the clean sheet, making three standout saves â€” including a key stop against Max Arfsten just before the opening goal. Lionel Messi nearly doubled the lead right before halftime with a curling shot from distance that narrowly missed the target.
        </p>

        <p className='mb-4'>
          Columbus Crew came out pressing in the second half, with Diego Rossi and Daniel Gazdag both coming close to equalizing. The Crewâ€™s final chance came in stoppage time but slipped just wide of the post.
