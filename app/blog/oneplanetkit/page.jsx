                    How MLS & adidas Are Changing the Game for a Greener Future
                </h2>

                <p className='mb-4'>
                    What if we told you a jersey could change the world? Not just the way the game looks. Not just the way you dress. But truly â€” the world.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    This season, Major League Soccer and adidas have dropped the 2025 One Planet Kit as part of the Greener Goals Week of Service â€” and itâ€™s more than just a pre-match top. Itâ€™s a statement. A movement. A symbol of a new era in soccer.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold text-[#020617] mb-6'>What Is the One Planet Kit?</h2>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    At first glance, itâ€™s a jersey. But look deeper:
                </p>
                <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2'>
                    <li><strong>Tree ring patterns</strong> â€” symbolizing the passage of time and the scars of climate change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Earthy, nature-inspired colors</strong> â€” reconnecting the game with the ground we play on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Made with recycled materials</strong> â€” sustainability without sacrificing performance or style.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    You wear it before the whistle blows. But the message lasts long after.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold text-[#020617] mb-6'>Football + Sustainability = A New Kind of Hero</h2>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    With this kit, MLS isnâ€™t just playing for points. Itâ€™s playing for the planet.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    Every player, every club, every match is now part of a team thatâ€™s fighting for cleaner air, healthier oceans, and a future that still has seasons to look forward to.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    Sounds idealistic? Itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s called Green Football â€” and itâ€™s already underway.
                </p>

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold text-[#020617] mb-6'>Why Does It Matter?</h2>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    Because football has power. Power to move people. To inspire the next generation. To remind us that thereâ€™s no Planet B.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    So when stars like Luciano Acosta or Riqui Puig rock the One Planet Kit â€” theyâ€™re not just warming up.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-4'>
                    Theyâ€™re showing up for every tree, every drop of water, every kid who deserves to grow up in a world that still has snow, flowers, forests, and dreams.
                </p>
