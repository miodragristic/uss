                <p className="mb-4">
                    Oakland Roots SC have made a bold mid-season move by appointing former U.S. Men’s National Team midfielder Benny Feilhaber as the new head coach. The decision comes just hours after parting ways with Gavin Glinton and Jesse Cormier. With the club struggling near the bottom of the USL Championship Western Conference, the hiring of Feilhaber signals a fresh start and a hopeful turnaround.

                Benny Feilhaber – A Great Name in U.S. Soccer
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Benny Feilhaber is no stranger to American soccer fans. Known for his creative playmaking and international experience, Feilhaber featured for the U.S. national team and had a distinguished playing career with clubs such as Hamburg (Germany), Derby County (England), and Aarhus (Denmark), as well as MLS teams including Sporting Kansas City, LAFC, and the New England Revolution.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    In coaching, Feilhaber has quickly built a résumé that includes serving as an assistant at UCLA, coaching Sporting Kansas City’s U-17 team, and leading Sporting KC II as head coach. Now, he faces his biggest challenge yet—resurrecting Oakland Roots' season.

                    What Oakland Gets with Feilhaber
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Tactical Modernization:</strong> Feilhaber brings fresh, modern tactics influenced by his international playing experience. His style emphasizes possession, fluid movement, and attacking intent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Player Development:</strong> Having worked with youth and reserve teams, Feilhaber has a strong background in player development. This is crucial for a club like Oakland that needs to maximize potential from emerging talent.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Locker Room Credibility:</strong> As a former U.S. international and seasoned pro, Feilhaber commands instant respect. His presence can reinvigorate a squad that has underperformed.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Emotional Reboot:</strong> The Roots are currently second-to-last in the Western Conference with just 10 points from 11 games. A leadership change, especially one with Feilhaber’s pedigree, can provide the emotional reset the team desperately needs.
                </p>

                    President’s Vision
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    “We are excited to have Benny Feilhaber take over through the end of the season,” said Oakland Roots President Lindsay Barenz. “We believe there is still a lot to fight for this season, and we have the players to make a strong run into the playoffs.”
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-[#020617] mb-6">
                    Challenges Ahead
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Feilhaber inherits a side low on confidence and form. The defense has been porous, and scoring has been inconsistent. Quick fixes won’t be easy, but with his tactical acumen and leadership, a turnaround is possible.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-[#020617] mb-6">
                    Final Thoughts
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Hiring Benny Feilhaber is a calculated risk that could pay big dividends. He represents a new generation of American coaches—tactically sharp, emotionally intelligent, and grounded in both domestic and international experience. For Oakland Roots, this might be the shake-up they need to salvage the 2025 season and build a stronger identity for the future.
