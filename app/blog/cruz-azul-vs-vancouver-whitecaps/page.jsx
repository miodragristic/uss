                <p className="mb-4">
                    Since joining MLS in 2011, Vancouver has steadily grown but never before reached this continental final. Now, under head coach Jesper Sørensen, the Whitecaps have combined tactical discipline, team unity, and grit to challenge the dominance of Liga MX.

                    Road to the Final: How Vancouver Defied the Odds
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Whitecaps’ journey to the final has been nothing short of impressive:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                    <li>Round One: edged Deportivo Saprissa 3–2 on aggregate</li>
                    <li>Round of 16: advanced past CF Monterrey on away goals after a 3–3 aggregate draw</li>
                    <li>Quarterfinals: overcame Pumas UNAM on away goals after another 3–3 aggregate tie</li>
                    <li>Semifinals: convincingly beat Inter Miami CF 5–1 on aggregate</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Eliminating two Mexican clubs and a Messi-led Inter Miami squad, Vancouver has proven their mettle against top Concacaf competition.

                    Current Form and Key Players
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Brian White</strong><br />
                    Second-highest scorer in the tournament with 5 goals this season, White has been Vancouver’s lethal finisher and offensive focal point.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Andrés Cubas</strong><br />
                    The Paraguayan midfielder anchors the team’s defensive structure and facilitates ball progression from midfield.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Pedro Vite</strong><br />
                    Creative and dynamic, Vite is the catalyst behind many of Vancouver’s attacking moves, combining skill and vision.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    The Whitecaps currently lead the MLS Western Conference and are second in the Supporters’ Shield standings, marking their best form since entering the league.

                    What’s at Stake: More Than Just a Trophy
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>First Ever Canadian Club to Win Concacaf Champions Cup</strong><br />
                    No Canadian side has lifted this prestigious trophy before. Toronto FC and CF Montréal reached finals but fell short. Vancouver can rewrite history tonight.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>$5 Million Prize Money</strong><br />
                    The financial rewards are substantial, with the winner pocketing $5 million — the richest prize in Concacaf club competition history.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    <strong>Qualification for FIFA Club World Cup 2029</strong><br />
                    The winner earns a coveted spot at the FIFA Club World Cup 2029, where they will compete against the world’s best clubs, including European and South American champions.

                    Challenges and Absences
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Vancouver will be without midfielder Sebastian Berhalter due to suspension and will miss injured designated player Ryan Gauld. Despite these setbacks, the squad’s depth and resilience remain strong.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Cruz Azul, a six-time Concacaf champion, have never lost a home match to an MLS team and will rely heavily on tournament top scorer Ángel Sepúlveda and creative midfielders Ignacio Rivero and Mateusz Bogusz.

                    Final Thoughts: Vancouver Whitecaps Represent More Than a Club
                </h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    This final is not just a clash between MLS and Liga MX; it symbolizes the rise of Canadian soccer on the continental stage. Vancouver Whitecaps embody teamwork, resilience, and ambition — traits that have brought them this far and could carry them to historic glory.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    Whatever the result, the Whitecaps have already elevated Canadian soccer’s profile. But a win would send shockwaves throughout North America and cement Vancouver’s place in Concacaf history.
