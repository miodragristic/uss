                    Cruz Azul delivered one of the most dominant performances in Concacaf history, dismantling Vancouver Whitecaps 5-0 in the 2025 Champions Cup final. With this victory, the Liga MX giants lifted their seventh continental trophy, tying Club América for the most in tournament history.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    The match was decided early. Cruz Azul scored on all four of their shots in the first half. Ignacio Rivero struck first in the 7th minute, followed by a long-range screamer from Lorenzo Faravelli. Ángel Sepúlveda added a sliding goal in the 37th, and Mateusz Bogusz capped off the half with a precise finish just before the break.

                    Minutes into the second half, Sepúlveda headed in his second goal of the night, securing the Golden Boot with nine goals in the tournament. Goalkeeper Kevin Mier earned the Golden Glove after a fourth clean sheet, with Vancouver failing to register a single shot on target.

                    Missing suspended midfielder Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver struggled to cope with Cruz Azul’s relentless pressure.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    This win marked Cruz Azul’s first Concacaf title since 2014. Their path to the final included a major semifinal win over rivals Club América. The triumph was a testament to their efficiency, spirit, and continental pedigree.
